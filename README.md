# UCD Resume

Last updated 5th Feb 2021.

Hover effect on menu items is no longer working. ? hover, hvr-sweep-to-bottom to be fixed.
Note: index.html href's were updated just now and copied to both resume.html and contact.html - perhaps related to this.
Fix for another day. Finished other than that.

## Gitpod Reminders

To run a frontend (HTML, CSS, Javascript only) application in Gitpod, in the terminal, type:
