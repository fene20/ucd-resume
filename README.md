# UCD Resume

6th February 2021
# 100% of UCD resume is training code from the Code Institute.

5th Feb 2021.
Hover effect on menu items is no longer working. ? hover, hvr-sweep-to-bottom to be fixed.
Note: index.html href's were updated just now and copied to both resume.html and contact.html - perhaps related to this.
Fix for another day. Finished other than that.
